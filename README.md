Package Structure
=================

The tools for analyzing experimental data from the SEFLab are implemented in an R package called
'seflab.tools.analysis'.

This package defines several data sources that encapsulate all the data processing activities needed to
read data files and produce time-aligned and consolidated data tables.

For more information see the documentation of the R package.
